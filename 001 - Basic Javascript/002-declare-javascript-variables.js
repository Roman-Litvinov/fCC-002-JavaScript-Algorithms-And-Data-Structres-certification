/* Variables in JS can have 8 different data types:
- undefined
- null
- boolean
- string
- symbol
- bigint
- number
- object
*/

// To define a variable, we use the keyword var, followed by the variable's name, like so:
var myName;

// Every JS statement is ended with a semicolon.
// Variable names can consist of numbers, letters, $, and _.
// They can't contain spaces or start with a number.
