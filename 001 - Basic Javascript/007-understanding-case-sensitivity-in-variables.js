/* JS variable names are case-sensitive, which opens a lot of opportunities to fuck up,
because variableName is not the same as VARIABLENAME or variablename.

camelCase - multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first
letter of each subsequent word capitalized, like so:

var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoFreakingLongOhGodWhenWillItStop;
*/


// Variable declarations (uninitialized):
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments (all vars were previously declared):
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
