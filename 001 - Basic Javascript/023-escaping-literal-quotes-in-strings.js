/* Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.
  If we want to use the single or double quotes as parts of a string literal,
  we ESCAPE these symbols by putting a backslash \ in front of them, like so:

console.log("This is a double quote that's been escaped to be a part of a string literal: \"");
*/


var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
console.log(myStr);
