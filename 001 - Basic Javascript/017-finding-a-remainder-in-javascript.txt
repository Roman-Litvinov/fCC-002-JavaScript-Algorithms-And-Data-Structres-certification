/* To find a remainder of the division of 2 numbers we use
  the remainder operator %, like so: */

var ostatok = 5 % 4;
console.log("The remainder of 5 divided by 4 equals "+ostatok+".");

// Only change code below this line

var remainder = 11 % 3;
console.log("\nThe remainder of 11 divided by 3 equals "+remainder+".");

// NOTE ON USE:
// We can use the remainder operator to see if a number is even,
// by dividing it by 2 and checking if the remainder is 0 (number is EVEN)
// or 1 (number is ODD).
