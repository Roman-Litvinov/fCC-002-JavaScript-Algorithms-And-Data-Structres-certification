// variables declared using CONST have the same properties as
// variables declared using LET - and also:
// - they are commonly given UPPERCASE identifiers
// - they MUST be initialized with a value at declaration time
// - once given value, they are IMMUTABLE - meaning they cannot
//   be changed!

// Example:
const SOMECONSTANT = "";
SOMECONSTANT = "yeah";   // gives TypeError: "SOMECONSTANT" is read-only
