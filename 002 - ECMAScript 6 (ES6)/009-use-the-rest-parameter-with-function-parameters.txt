/* REDUCE method of Array object
- takes an array and returns a single value - the accumulated result of the REDUCER function
- executes some REDUCER function on each of the array's elements
- doesn't execute the reducer function on empty elements of the array
- has the following format:

  someArray.reduce(reducerFunction, initialValue)

where:
- reducerFunction - the function to execute on each array element from left to right
- initialValue (optional) - a value passed to the reducer function as a starting value
  of the accumulated total

The REDUCER function has the following format:

  functionName(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr)

where:
- total - ASSUMED TO BE the previous result of the function's execution
- currentValue - ASSUMED TO BE the current element of the array
- currentIndex - (optional) index of the current element in the array
- arr - (optional) the array the current element belongs to

*/

// EXAMPLE
// "...args" is a REST parameter, allowing us to accept any number of arguments,
// all of which will be saved in the array named "args".
// We will then reduce the array "args" to a single value which will be the sum
// of all its elements.
// add() is the reducer function in this case. It will be run on each element
// of args array and add the element's value first to 0 (initial value), and then to
// its previous result.
// The accumulated result will then be returned.
const sum = (...args) => {
  function add(a,b) {
    return a+b;
  }
  return args.reduce(add,0);
}


// test cases:
console.log(sum(0,1,2));
console.log(sum(1,2,3,4));
console.log(sum(5));
console.log(sum(0));

/* original lesson code:
const sum = (x, y, z) => {
  const args = [x, y, z];
  return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
