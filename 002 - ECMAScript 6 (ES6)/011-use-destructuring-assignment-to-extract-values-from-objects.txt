// destructuring assignment:
// when we assign an object to the list of variables,
// the variables get values of the object properties 
// with the same name. Example:

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// assign values of properties "today" and "tomorrow"
// of HIGH_TEMPERATURES object to the new variables
// named "today" and "tomorrow":
const {today, tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;

try {
  console.log("today:", today);
  console.log("tomorrow:", tomorrow);
  console.log("yesterday:", yesterday);
} catch (ex){
  console.log(ex);
}


/* the above is equivalent to:
const.today = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
const.tomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow;
