/* SPREAD OPERATOR "..."
- used to EXPAND arrays and other expressions in places
  where multiple parameters or elements are expected,
  e.g. in function calls with expected multiple arguments
- takes a spreadable/iterable value and turns it into a list of multiple values

SPREAD OPERATOR does the opposite of REST PARAMETERS (both use the "..." syntax):
whereas rest parameters are used in function DEFINITIONS, to turn individual 
values into an array, spread operator is used in function CALLS, to EXPAND
the given array into a list of multiple comma-separated parameters.

Example - function taking rest parameters which will be stored in the array "args":
someFunction(...args) {
  // function code
}

Example - spread operator expanding the array used as an argument into multiple 
arguments (because the function expects it)
var someArray = [1,2,10,75,11,0];
var result = Math.max(...someArray);

// test - spread operation on a string - turning it into an array
let str = "whatever, dude";
let spreadStr = [...str];         // string is spread and turned into an ARRAY of individual characters.
                                  // WHY? Because we're using SQUARE BRACKETS to enclose the spread operator
console.log("str is:", str);
console.log("spreadStr array is:", spreadStr);

// test - spread operation on a string - turning it into an object
let strX = "yeah, man";
let spreadStrX = {...strX};         // string is spread and turned into an OBJECT of {numbered key: individual character value} pairs.
                                  // WHY? Because we're using CURLY BRACES to enclose the spread operator
console.log("strX is:", strX);
console.log("spreadStrX object is:", spreadStrX);




// "...someArray" expands someArray into multiple values
// that Math.max() finds the largest out of of:
var someArray = [1,2,10,75,11,0];
var result = Math.max(...someArray);
console.log("result is: "+result);


// IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING THE ARRAYS:
// using assignment "=" on 2 arrays like below only 
// points arr2 variable to the same array as arr1:
let arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
let arr2;
arr2 = arr1;
// if we change an element of arr1, it reflects in arr2:
console.log("arr1 is: "+arr1+"\narr2 is: "+arr2);
arr1[2] = "JUN";
console.log("We changed arr1[2] from 'MAR' to 'JUN'.");
console.log("After the change, arr1 is: "+arr1+"\nAfter the change, arr2 is: "+arr2+"\n");


// We need to use the spread syntax - thus expanding array arr1 
// into a new ARRAY LITERAL and assigning that to arr2, instead
// of simply pointing arr2 to the same array. Observe:

arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
// using spread syntax, turn arr1 into a new array literal
// and assign it to arr2:
arr2 = [...arr1];

// if we change an element of arr1 now, it does NOT reflect in arr2,
// arr2 stays the same because it's pointing to a different array:
console.log("arr1 is: "+arr1+"\narr2 is: "+arr2);
arr1[2] = "JUN";
console.log("We changed arr1[2] from 'MAR' to 'JUN'. ");
console.log("After the change, arr1 is: "+arr1+"\nAfter the change, arr2 is: "+arr2);
console.log("arr2 is not changed - it's pointing to a separate array literal value.")


// lesson challenge:
arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];
arr2 = [...arr1];
