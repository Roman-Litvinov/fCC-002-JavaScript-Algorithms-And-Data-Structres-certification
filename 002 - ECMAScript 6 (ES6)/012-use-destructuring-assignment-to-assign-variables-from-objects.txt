/* destructuring assignment allows to give different names
to the variables that receive values of properties.
The new names are specified like so:

  {propertyName: newVariableName} = objectName;

where:
- propertyName:     the name of the property of the object that we are extracting
- newVariableName:  the name of the variable that we are storing the value in, that
                    is different from the property name

Example:
const user = {name:"John Doe", age:34};
const {name:userName, age:userAge};       // saves properties "name" and "age"
                                          // into vars "userName" and "userAge"

*/ 

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// extract "today" and "tomorrow" property values and save
// them into variables with different names from property names,
// "highToday" and "highTomorrow":
const {today : highToday, tomorrow : highTomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
