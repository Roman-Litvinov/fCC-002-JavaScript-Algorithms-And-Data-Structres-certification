// While using CONST to declare a variable prevents re-assigning
// the variable identifier to point to a different value by using
// the assignment operator "=", WE CAN STILL MUTATE/CHANGE 
// THE OBJECTS/ARRAYS/FUNCTIONS/ETC that the identifier points to.
// 

// Example
// We can't assign a different array to constant s,
// but we can change the array (that it's been assigned) itself:

const s = [5, 7, 2];
function editInPlace() {
  // change the array to [2, 5, 7]
  // NOTE: using s = [2, 5, 7] would be invalid
  // s = [2, 5, 7];    // throws TypeError: "s" is read-only
  
  // we can use sort() method of Array object, like so:
  s.sort();
  // we could also change elements directly:
  /*
  s[0] = 2;
  s[1] = 5;
  s[2] = 7;
  */
}
editInPlace();
console.log(s);
